# Go Static Site Generator
## Why did I start this project?
* This project was made so that I can automate writing descriptions of my projects through readme's for my portfolio website. I want to add tons of awesome projects on my portfolio but I dont want to write tons of descriptions!
* I wanted to learn more about parsing data.

## Design
* Crawler
** I needed a crawler to go though my project directory and collect Readme files
* Parser
** The parse was made to parse markdown information using libraries like Frontmatter, Goldmark, and HTML/template.
* Generator
** The generator produces the HTML file detailing my projects and their descriptions. It also focuses more on the templating aspect.
